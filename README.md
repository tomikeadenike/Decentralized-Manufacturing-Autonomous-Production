# Decentralized Manufacturing Autonomous Production

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for managing autonomous manufacturing operations using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This system provides a complete framework for decentralized manufacturing operations, enabling autonomous production facilities to operate with minimal human intervention while maintaining quality, transparency, and accountability.

## Architecture

The system consists of five interconnected smart contracts:

### 1. Factory Verification Contract (`factory-verification.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Validates and certifies autonomous manufacturing facilities
- **Key Features**:
    - Factory registration and verification
    - Status management (pending, verified, suspended, revoked)
    - Certification tracking
    - Authorized verifier management

### 2. Production Orchestration Contract (`production-orchestration.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Coordinates autonomous production operations
- **Key Features**:
    - Production order management
    - Capacity planning and allocation
    - Order lifecycle tracking
    - Factory resource optimization

### 3. Quality Assurance Contract (`quality-assurance.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Manages automated quality control processes
- **Key Features**:
    - Quality inspection creation and tracking
    - Automated result evaluation
    - Quality standards management
    - Inspector authorization

### 4. Supply Chain Integration Contract (`supply-chain-integration.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Connects autonomous production with suppliers
- **Key Features**:
    - Supplier registration and verification
    - Shipment tracking
    - Inventory management
    - Reliability scoring

### 5. Human Oversight Contract (`human-oversight.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Manages human-machine collaboration
- **Key Features**:
    - Alert system for anomalies
    - Operator assignment and tracking
    - Intervention logging
    - Resolution management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain node
- Clarity development environment
- Basic understanding of smart contracts

### Deployment

1. Deploy contracts in the following order:
   ```bash
   clarinet deploy factory-verification
   clarinet deploy production-orchestration
   clarinet deploy quality-assurance
   clarinet deploy supply-chain-integration
   clarinet deploy human-oversight
   ```

2. Initialize system:
   ```clarity
   ;; Register initial factory
   (contract-call? .factory-verification register-factory 
     "AutoFactory-001" 
     "Industrial District A" 
     u1000 
     (list "ISO-9001" "ISO-14001"))

   ;; Set factory capacity
   (contract-call? .production-orchestration set-factory-capacity u1 u1000)
   ```

### Usage Examples

#### Register a Factory
```clarity
(contract-call? .factory-verification register-factory 
  "Smart Factory Alpha" 
  "123 Manufacturing St" 
  u500 
  (list "ISO-9001" "CE-Mark"))
```

#### Create Production Order
```clarity
(contract-call? .production-orchestration create-order 
  u1 
  "Widget-Type-A specifications" 
  u100 
  u2 
  u1000)
```

#### Perform Quality Inspection
```clarity
(contract-call? .quality-assurance create-inspection 
  u1 
  u1 
  (list "dimension" "weight" "finish") 
  (list u95 u98 u92) 
  u95 
  "All parameters within tolerance")
```

## Error Codes

### Factory Verification (100-199)
- `u100`: Unauthorized access
- `u101`: Factory not found
- `u102`: Factory already exists
- `u103`: Invalid status

### Production Orchestration (200-299)
- `u200`: Unauthorized access
- `u201`: Order not found
- `u202`: Invalid status
- `u203`: Insufficient capacity

### Quality Assurance (300-399)
- `u300`: Unauthorized access
- `u301`: Inspection not found
- `u302`: Invalid result

### Supply Chain Integration (400-499)
- `u400`: Unauthorized access
- `u401`: Supplier not found
- `u402`: Shipment not found
- `u403`: Invalid status

### Human Oversight (500-599)
- `u500`: Unauthorized access
- `u501`: Alert not found
- `u502`: Invalid priority
- `u503`: Invalid status

## Security Considerations

- All contracts implement proper access controls
- Critical operations require authorization
- State changes are validated
- Error handling prevents invalid states

## Testing

Run the test suite using:
```bash
npm test
```
